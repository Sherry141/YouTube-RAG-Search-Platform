NASA figured this out back in the 1980s.
They were looking at ways
to optimize their astronauts
because when you are up in orbit,
depending on what orbit you
are in, you are rotating
around the planet maybe
10, 20 times per 24 hours.
So you're seeing 10 to
20 sunsets and sunrises.
So your sleep is a total mess,
and you can safety check almost everything
in terms of technology.
But the one weak link in a space mission
is this thing called the human being.
That's where errors typically happen.
And what they found was that these naps
produced almost a 20% boost in short naps,
20% boost in their alertness,
and almost a 50% boost in
their task productivity.
And it was so powerful that it translated
to the terrestrial employees
of NASA on the ground,
and it became what was known
as the NASA nap culture.
