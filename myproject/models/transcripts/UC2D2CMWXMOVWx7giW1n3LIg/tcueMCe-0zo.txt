The thing to worry about
is not when your mentors
and coaches are pushing you.
It's when they stop pushing you
that you should really worry
because that means they've
basically given up on you.
So that always rung in my mind.
Yeah, what I call the person
who just is no longer maintaining
high standards for you,
I call that a protector mindset.
That it's almost like, "it's
going to be too much trouble
to see you dealing with
stress from being pushed
that I am going to protect
you from that stress.
Maybe I care about you,
but I'm not going to knock you down
or hold you to a high standard."
And I see that a lot in coaches,
I see it in teachers, I see it in parents.
For me, the opposite problematic version
is what I call an enforcer mindset.
This is like, "here's the standard
and I'm going to hold you to it
and it's up to you to meet it or not."
