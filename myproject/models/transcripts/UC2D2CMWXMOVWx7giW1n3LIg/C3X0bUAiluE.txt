There are a lot of
studies now really showing
pretty significant
effects of e-cigarette use
on heart and lungs.
Not only all the
chemicals we've mentioned,
but also the flavorants.
There's cinnamon aldehyde,
another aldehyde,
there's vanillin, there's
the buttery flavor
that's in there is also a lot of concern.
You then take it and really
inhale the resulting aerosol,
and then we're seeing
the lesions on the lungs.
We're seeing young people who
have been using e-cigarettes
having lung collapses, pneumonia,
asthma amongst people
who've not had, seizures.
One of the teens I know who
was using four pods a day
was having seizures.
Makes sense because
nicotine is a stimulant.
Yes.
So it can cause runaway
excitability in the brain
if too much is taken.
So if that's happening
in the living child,
that can't be good.
Yeah.
That can't be good.
That can't be good.
Lungs, bloodstream,
everything.
And all the aldehydes
are carcinogens.
Correct.
We know they cause cancer.
Right, right.
And so that's why there's
a lot of concern there.
