want to\n","learn how to build a website without\n","writing a single line of code if yes\n","then you are at the right place in this\n","video i'm going to show you how you can\n","use wlow a no code website builder tool\n","to create interactive and advanced\n","websites without writing a single line\n","of code my name is ashoke and you are\n","watching the wfl crash course\n","two thousand and twentyfour so let's dive in hey so first thing\n","we are going to learn the layouts how\n","you can create layouts in webflow using\n","flexbox css grid columns or images\n","buttons headings and paragraphs to\n","create a nice looking website so as you\n","can see on my screen here i have a wlow\n","project open but before that let's\n","discuss this pixel website uh i want to\n","discuss about the layout here so as you\n","can see it's a\n","layout of uh one column right one column\n","layout or just a one row layout right\n","inside that you have heading you have a\n","paragraph and and you have a button here\n","right after that you have image or let's\n","say you can create a video or anything\n","that you want right you have it's a one\n","column layout right but here you see\n","it's a two column\n","layout so layout is the most important\n","thing when you are building a website if\n","your designer is providing something to\n","you uh in in a figma file on this pixel\n","file we are using this pixel a lot these\n","days to create designs you can uh give\n","it a try it's not a sponsored video but\n","you can give it a try it's an amazing\n","tool right here all these ticky\n","interactions right uh to create uh\n","interactive layout see the way they are\n","creating these layouts uh here again one\n","column but here you have let's say a\n","gried

have a smartphone in our\n","pocket that has a pretty impressive\n","camera so we're going to see how we can\n","take those images put them into some\n","kind of storage to create a media\n","library where we're going to be able to\n","not only upload those images but\n","transform them such as cropping and\n","resizing we're going to use ai to\n","enhance those images and we're even\n","going to see how we can add some filters\n","and some fun effects like remove the\n","background to really transform our\n","images into something new particularly\n","we're going to pretty much build a\n","google photos clone where if you're not\n","familiar with the concept it's pretty\n","much that media library i was talking\n","about where once you have all of your\n","images uploaded to your library you can\n","start to do things like editing them\n","where maybe i want to improve that image\n","with ai or use ai to remove the\n","background or we can also do things like\n","cropping where i can dynamically crop it\n","to a to a common format and i can even\n","add filters such as maybe i want to have\n","this image a cooler tone but one of my\n","favorite parts is taking this a step\n","further with those creations where maybe\n","i want to include a couple images and i\n","want to create a collage out of them i\n","can easily select the images that i want\n","i can trigger the action to create a\n","collage and now i have my beautiful\n","collage that i can save to my library\n","and now i can share with m\n","learn sql for analytics vlad is a data\n","engineer and in

solve hard sql problems of\n","the kind that are suggested during data\n","interviews the course assumes no\n","previous knowledge of sql or programming\n","although it will be helpful if you've\n","work with spreadsheets such as microsoft\n","excel or google sheets because there's a\n","lot of analogies between manipulating\n","data in spreadsheets and doing it in sql\n","and i also

i\n","just want to address the fact that like\n","if you look at ben awad tik tok if you\n","look at ben awad youtube like production\n","has slowed down a whole lot i just want\n","to make sure that the mafia didn't like\n","do like a a hit on your entire family at\n","their family reunion like in punisher\n","and that there's like that everything is\n","cool sorry that we can't talk about it\n","anymore all right all right man unless\n","you if you want to continue living we\n","can't talk about it okay okay m is the\n","word the the the the short answer is\n","i've just like been very

saw\n","youtube and tik tok and twitter as a\n","thing that like i invest into and i put\n","thought into um and so once i stop\n","thinking about those things it's harder\n","for me to like do them

teach you how to use kaboom js to\n","create a twod platformer game based on the\n","classic video game hi everyone welcome\n","to this new tutorial today we will be\n","building a kirby like platformer using\n","typescript and the kaboom jaz library so\n","kaboom jaz is a library for making games\n","and it can be used with typescript and\n","here i'm just showcasing the project\n","we're going to build so here it's a\n","kirby like character that can swallow\n","enemies and shoot stars on once uh it is\n","swallowed and then here you have a\n","beautiful level layout by the way i made\n","all the assets myself and then when you\n","get hit like three times you respond to\n","the original position and that's\n","basically it so let's jump right into\n","making a game like that what you're\n","going to need for this tutorial is first\n","of all i assume a basic understanding of\n","typescript so maybe brush up on\n","typescript you know just watch a\n","tutorial or something before following\n","this tutorial and i'm going to also use\n","node so you need to be familiar with\n","node so here i'm going to open up a\n","terminal window and i'm going to set up\n","the project differently than what you're\n","used to if you're watching my if you\n","have watched my previous tutorial\n","tutorials sorry is that usually i would\n","need to use index.html etc and then\n","paste the links to the libraries or use\n","javascript modules here we're going to\n","use a bundler it's called vit so i'm\n","going to do npm run uh not npm\n","npm create\n","at vit uh not create vit\n","at latest and then dot so that we we\n","specify that we want the project to be\n","scaffolded inside the current folder so\n","by the way i'm using vss code for this\n","tutorial i recommend that you use it as\n","well you can install it etc now if\n","you're familiar with typescript you're\n","probably using uh vs code already so i'm\n","just going to go over so after having\n","done npm create v at latest we're going\n","to select the vanilla template and then\n","the typescript tem\n","if you wanted to build a new compiler if\n","you wanted to build something that's\n","like really arcane yeah but that you\n","know a lot about and you have a lot of\n","taste again a lot of opinions about a\n","lot of expertise on yes often you should\n","listen to that expertise\n","music\n","yeah this is dalton plus michael and\n","today we're going to talk about commit\n","or validate when to trust your gut as a\n","startup founder so i'll set this one up\n","i find myself encountering\n","two situations at yc um situation one is\n","a founder who used to work at a company\n","built something extremely valuable at\n","that company um it was deployed the\n","company loved that thing and that\n","founder thought to themselves hm maybe\n","other companies would want it and so\n","they left started yc to try to\n","productize the thing they built example\n","two two kids maybe worked a year out of\n","college and they want to start a startup\n","they're trying to figure out what to\n","work on they're both technical they're\n","smart they're bright they want to get\n","rich don't know what to do yet we see\n","these two patterns constantly and i find\n","it interesting on how we give advice i'm\n","like hey when which one of these people\n","yeah which one of these examples should\n","trust their guy yeah basically we're\n","saying that general\n","advice doesn't apply well to these two\n","cases we are admitting that you actually\n","need bespoke advice yes depending on\n","which category you're in that's a little\n","bit different and so again to make the\n","extreme version of trusting your gut\n","this is when founders think they're\n","steve jobs you're like well steve jobs\n","never talked to customers steve jobs and\n","he would never give people what they\n","asked for no one asked for the iphone he\n","had to like envision it he didn't even\n","use a phone invent to the i and so the\n","extreme comic book version of trusting\n","your gut yes is you talk to no one yes\n","you somehow from having great taste or a\n","great internal yeah idea of what want\n","you just manifest it and it's totally\n","unique and different and the opposite\n","extreme is the the comic b\n","it feels like there's more energy around\n","this batch than there has been for as\n","long as i can remember for any yc batch\n","like what do you think's happening\n","there's a platform shift and this is the\n","moment where every single sas dollar in\n","the world uh it's up for grabs again the\n","bouch threex arr in three months which is pretty\n","cool that's a great growth rate yeah\n","it's a fun time to build it's the best\n","time ever i mean as a as a builder it's\n","like the technology just does such a\n","different thing than what you expected\n","before\n","music\n","welcome back to another episode of the\n","light cone we are for group partners at\n","y combinator and we funded hundreds of\n","companies many dozens of which have gone\n","on to become unicorns this is jared i'm\n","gary this is harge and this is diana we\n","just finished the winter two thousand and twentyfour batch of y\n","combinator and it feels really really\n","different doesn't it it does let's talk\n","about how this batch is so different\n","from the batches that we funded in the\n","past some of it is you actually need to\n","know where we've been and where we are\n","right now in order
