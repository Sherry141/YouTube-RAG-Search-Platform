This video is a Judo training session with Travis Stevens from a while back. He's a 2016 Olympic silver medalist in Judo, and one of the greatest American judoka ever. I've trained judo and jujitsu for many years, and took some time off on the judo side, focusing more on submission grappling than throwing. But I'm hoping to get back into it with Jimmy Pedro, the legendary judo coach out in Boston. I love judo too much. I miss it. Big thank you to Craig Jones and the B Team for letting us use their gym for this judo session. And I should also say that Austin, in general, is amazing for martial arts. We've got 10th Planet with Gabe Tuttle, New Wave with John Danaher, Gordon Ryan, Nicholas Meregali, and others. B Team with Craig Jones, Nikki Rod, Nikki Ryan, and others, and many more. I highly recommend you check out these places, and who knows? Maybe you'll see me there, and we get a chance to train. And now, dear friends, here's the 2016 Olympic silver medalist in judo, Travis Stevens. - I've been a fan of yours for a long time. Thank you for talking a little judo with me today, man. Spread the knowledge, here we go. - My goal is to make you go up, and then I'm gonna go under, and then put you on your back right where you were standing. That's the idea, but I actually don't have to do much lifting. So when I come down and I split, I hold tight, I get a strong pull when I back up. Now you're right where you were standing. - The fundamental movement here is the splitting either the hips, or you're doing some-- - Leg to the outside. - You've just gotten really good at doing this step. - And generating power from it, where when I kick, like, I press it hard enough where I'm not overextending this leg, and this moves. What a lot of people try to do is, they go here and they overcommit. Now that's why you can't take that step. I try to hike and let that slide into place naturally. It's important that the angle is here instead of straight on, unless you're gonna get me to turn and give you that angle. - Okay. - So it's very difficult for you, like, if you take a grip here on the side, and then you were to try to come in and split my legs, right there, you see how I can start to slide and there's a gap on this side. A lot of times when I do this, people slip off to this side and you end up missing it. But if I change your angle to here, now come in. - Oh. - See how you got my hip? - And so you're not worried about coming around from this-- - Because the second I try to lift and jump over, that leg will be sliding back. And that's going to... If I try to step over, my weight's going up. When back up, you're gonna amplify that. (Lex flipping) - This is a dream come true by the way. So, you're known for this interesting variation of just the say Nagi throw where you grab the lapel. Can you explain how that works? - In a basic sense, you're gonna take a grip here. Don't get pushed, like, resist there and then this happens. I get that back and forth push so that it's effortless on my front leg. So, that there. And see how you naturally get pulled forward when I slip the pressure. That's the basics of it. Now I have to get you to a point where you can't sprawl and lower your center gravity. So what I do for that is, when I lower that weight and I lift that weight. So I just hold it. That way when you pop up on your toes, the hand at the top of the arc holds you while I slip underneath, and then I can catch you on my hips. So I've gotta get there before you get lower than I do. - And then you're doing this big-- - Yes, so, typically if I find my point at the center, my foot starts there, and then I replace, and I slip, and then we come back out. If you're gripping and I'm holding your hand, which sometimes I do, if I press you at some point... There, see how I'm getting you to stand up? That leg is light. Now I can come back through. - Yeah. - I press 'em until they press back hard enough where we go from this angle to up, and then I can slide on. And let's say like, right? I can't attack, because this leg is in front. I also, if you have a good stable position, I can't necessarily move that foot. But your off balance point is here at the front, and there at the rear. So, if I take my pinky and I hit that point, you're gonna turn and face me. Thank you. Now it's not in front anymore, so I never had to move it. And so when you're in this position, go ahead and move on that, and then not be to that front position. Boom, wait. The second you see me starting to rotate, add to that, yeah. - And then you step in. - Yeah. There you go. (Lex flipping) There you go. And then now you don't feel the weight. (Lex flipping) (fighters struggling) - Thank you brother. - Of course.\", \"day six of building an AAS to 10K a month my co-founder Nas and I decided to leave everything behind and moved to San Francisco to build our Dream SAS we left behind our home family friends and even our relationships first things first it's time to settle into our new home but we realized we got a big problem we found out that our Visions aren't fully aligned Kazi wants to focus 100% on the sasay tool but me I want to still Focus 8 20% on my current business and 80% on the SAS AI to I think that's fair my problem isn't fairness mhm what I'm thinking is what if we got together how much farther would we go and how much faster would we go could we do in 1 month what we would have done in three so if you want to be on this journey with us follow us for day seven\", 'basically two legs across your partner\\'s body. I\\'ve got my back to you, all right? And I\\'ve already pulled you off balance with my hands. And then I\\'m going to just flex my legs up just as you\\'re coming onto my back, and then you\\'re going to go over if I coordinate it all right. If it doesn\\'t get coordinated right, then you\\'re going to come right on my back and try to rip my arm off, you know? So, yeah, gotta get it right. - What was, if you can convert it into words, some secret ingredients that allowed you to pull it off at the highest levels, the tai otoshi? - The hands start every technique. So getting the repetition right, first of all. So to get the repetition right, you need a good partner. So actually training your partner to react in the right way is just as important as learning the throw. So actually, what happens is, we could get a lesson of beginners. We teach the throw, and then go, \"Right, off you go.\" And 90% of them will get it wrong because their partner\\'s not reacting in the right way. So half of it is to get the person to react as they should. So if I was doing it with you, you and I, first thing I\\'d teach you to do is to react the way I want you to react, and then I\\'d react the way that you want me to react. So then we\\'d have success with it, rather than you leaning back in the wrong way or resisting or frightened you\\'re going over. So, actually, that\\'s why nine times out of ten, people get the technique wrong. - It\\'s actually fascinating to me because in the United States, where I came up, judo, I mean, the level of judo is not comparable to the level of judo in the rest of the world. Of course, the Pedro Center is an exception to that. - [Neil] Certain athletes, yeah. - Certain athletes. When I trained recently with Jimmy Pedro, it\\'s like even the 16-year-old-kids are just all deadly. So it was terrifying. But I remember the Russian National Team came through Philadelphia. And one of the things that really impressed me is just how much easier judo was, training judo with them. They moved correctly as uke, as the people getting thrown. Every aspect of their body movement was correct in terms of it felt right to be throwing them, to be training with them. Everything about the gripping, about the position of their hips, about the shoulder, everything. It was fun, it was easy. And I always felt like I was learning. So I think all of that is loaded in, I guess, into proper training. So you\\'re developing through the throws. You\\'re developing the right technique. - Yeah, you have to develop between, I always had training partners that I trained with up to each Olympic Games, and we worked together for the, we did the skills together, and then we worked together in order to make techniques work, and we got it moving as quickly as we could. And one of the worst things that I see is, and I see a lot of YouTube stuff with coaches. - Here we go. - Don\\'t even start me on that. Don\\'t even start me on that. But, you know. (Lex laughing) - What? - You\\'re laughing because you know what I\\'m talking about, right? - Yeah, no I\\'m actually laughing because I\\'m enjoying you talking trash. (Lex and Neil laughing) But talk about technique. - Yeah, just, well, the coaches and the clipboard guys, you know, with the clipboards and the stopwatches, and they got these kids running up and down the mat and then doing Uchikomi of something that technically incorrect ten times, and then running up and doing another ten at the other side, and actually mixing everything together, and it\\'s just a mess. - [Lex] Yeah, technique is important. - Just technical mess. - That said, some of it is conditioning-type stuff that you were doing. So what is like the hardest type of physical conditioning you were doing? - Probably ran too much. You know, when I was a kid, if I could go back now, I wouldn\\'t run as much. And I ran hard and I ran strong. And I remember doing London Marathon one time, and I said, \"I\\'m never going to do it again.\" I never. But I ran, you know, and I was trying to, the problem was when I did the London Marathon is I was trying to beat three hours. - It\\'s that desire to win. - It\\'s totally insane. You know, it was insane. And I went out through half marathon in what I thought was a good time. Anyway, I got to 16, 17 miles and totally blew. - So you went out too fast. - Yeah, I went out too fast. - And then you just wanted to keep going. - I died, absolutely. I died, Lex. (Lex laughing) I got in. I crossed the line. I remember seeing this bridge over there, right? And the bridge, it was the finishing line over the bridge. And I had to get over. It was the longest bridge I\\'ve ever, ever walked over. Like walk, run. So I got over the bridge, and I took one step over the line like that. And there was a guy over there, and he was trying to rush everybody through, you know, and he was going, \"Come on, come on, come on. There\\'s people behind you.\" Get your hands off me. (Lex laughing) I said, \"Get your hands off me now.\" Like that, because we\\'re going to fall out, and I couldn\\'t move. I couldn\\'t move. I was white. - And it\\'s amazing that you made it to the finish line, though. - I did. I got over there, and yeah,', \"[Music] n [Music] welcome back to the free C Camp podcast I'm Quincy Larson teacher and founder of freecodecamp.org each week we're bringing you Insight from developers Founders and ambitious people getting into Tech this week we're joined by none other than Ben Awad who is a developer he is a prolific Creator on both YouTube and Tik Tok and very importantly he is working on on a new game which already has like you know more than 100,000 installs uh in the app store called void pet which I would describe as emotional support Pokemon thank you Quincy thank you for having me yeah it's great to have you here man like uh I checked my calendar before we joined this call and the last time you and I talked was four years ago and that's like a sixth of your life right like if you don't want me asking how old are you I'm 26 yeah so need the divisions yeah so like that's a lot of time for Ben to be out of the fold uh sorry I'm a Ben Folds fan with with the freeo camp Community uh but you've been getting a ton of stuff done but first I just want to address the fact that like if you look at Ben Awad Tik Tok if you look at Ben Awad YouTube like production has slowed down a whole lot I just want to make sure that the mafia didn't like do like a a hit on your entire family at their family reunion like in Punisher and that there's like that everything is cool sorry that we can't talk about it anymore all right all right man unless you if you want to continue living we can't talk about it okay okay m is the word the the the the short answer is I've just like been very busy working on void pet the startup and it's like very hard to like run and take care of two babies at the same time and social media as its own baby and its own I always saw YouTube and Tik Tok and Twitter as a thing that like I invest into and I put thought into um and so once I stop thinking about those things it's harder for me to like do them in autopilot I can't autopilot post basically I I like put a lot of thought even though it may not seem like it at times um and now that my thought is elsewhere it's like not happening at the moment I'm never I'm going to post more in the future at some point in time I don't think I'm done with social media period I still like social media and posting and making videos and talking about tech but currently I'm just like so swamped that it's it has been happening as you've been seeing and as everyone else has been seeing as well and they're like when Ben when's the next video I'm like I'm not even planning a next video at the moment unfortunately wow yeah well I mean that's totally cool that like you have two high standards to just put out you know busy or like merely serviceable content you want to put out the really top shelf Ben aad uh and you're not able to dedicate the time and attention to be able to do that right now so um maybe we can talk about uh social media just because like a lot of people are saying like social media is dead like uh or it's it's definitely like a shadow of his former self Elon Musk has been like doing weird stuff with Twitter I refuse to call it X because it's probably just going to be sold to like some other company in a few years and like they'll Rebrand at Twitter so why bother like switching um you know obviously people are very paranoid about using like Facebook products based off of like Cambridge analytica and the many many scandals that have transpired and is this just like a company who I that I want to support personally like for me that the answer is not really um and then at the same time you've got uh you know Tik Tok might be banned in the US hopefully not I am not I'm like a very anti-censorship and I think it's a horrible precedent for websites to be just wholesale blocked like they are in China for example so um so obviously I'm very much loading this question is social media dead but but like what do you think about the social media landscape right now as somebody who has I don't know hundreds of thousands maybe millions of of like followers on Tik Tok and some of these other platforms I mean I think the dope thing right now is Twitter's paying you money to post and that didn't happen like years ago and like that it's like a huge motivator because if you were just like derping around and putting like funny memes on there you now have the potential to like make actual money now unfortunately it is like kind of pennies and you have to be like really getting out there to like get any kind of return so like that is kind of like the downside too but like the plus side is like now every single one of like these social media websites is like you can make money just like posting on them that's very cool that's very motivating and so I really like that part like Makey bu is cool for just like making videos and sharing it on that I will say like I think I have had less uh I've been enjoying like Tech Twitter less than I used to and I didn't know just because I've been like busy thinking about other things or like the conversations have like changed a little\"]\n"]},{"data":{"text/markdown":["Travis Stevens is
